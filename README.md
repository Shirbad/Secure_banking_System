## 🔑 API Endpoints

### 🔐 Authentication

* POST `/api/auth/register`
* POST `/api/auth/login`

---

### 💳 Accounts

* POST `/api/accounts`
* GET `/api/accounts/{id}`
* GET `/api/accounts`

---

### 💰 Transactions

* PUT `/api/accounts/{id}/deposit`
* PUT `/api/accounts/{id}/withdraw`
* PUT `/api/accounts/transfer`
* GET `/api/transactions/{accountId}`

---

### 💸 Payments

* POST `/api/payments/pay`
* GET `/api/payments/{paymentId}`

---

### 🏆 Analytics

* GET `/api/accounts/top-spenders?n=5`

---

## 🔒 Authentication

After login, include JWT token in request headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/banking-system-backend.git
cd banking-system-backend
```

---

### 2️⃣ Configure Database

Update `application.properties`:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/banking_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

---

### 3️⃣ Run the Application

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Use **Postman** to test APIs:

1. Register a user
2. Login → receive JWT token
3. Add token in Authorization header
4. Access secured endpoints

---
